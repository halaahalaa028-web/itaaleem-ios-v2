/// own [FlutterSecureStorage] entry — never hardcoded, never stored
/// alongside the video itself. Deliberately a separate secure-storage
/// instance from [SecureStorageService]/`auth_token`, so logging out (which
/// clears that one) can never make already-downloaded videos
/// undecryptable.
///
/// Every file gets its own random base IV (`generateIv()`, stored on its
/// `offline_videos` row — see `OfflineDatabase`), never the file's plain
/// bytes. CTR mode is used specifically so the video can be split into
/// independently-decryptable [chunkSize]-byte chunks: [chunkIvFor] derives
/// chunk N's own IV by advancing the file's base IV (as a 128-bit counter)
/// by N chunks' worth of AES blocks — mathematically identical to running
/// one continuous keystream across the whole file, which is what lets
/// `LocalRangeServer` decrypt an arbitrary byte range by seeking straight to
/// the chunk(s) that overlap it instead of replaying the file from byte 0.
